<p>I'm <a href="/kb/Q45320427">Michael Ringgaard</a>, founder and CEO of
Ringgaard Research. Ringgaard Research is a not-for-profit company that
develops and maintains the
<a href="https://github.com/ringgaard/sling">SLING</a> system as well as doing
research relating to knowledge management and natural language processing.
After 13 year as a software engineer at Google Research working with natural
language processing, I resigned from Google in September 2020 to start for
myself.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>I started development of SLING at Google back in 2016, although the earliest
prototypes date back to 2014. I wanted to design a system that was efficient
for working with knowledge bases as well as general semantic annotation of text.
We used this for building a general frame semantic parser. The parser was made
open source in 2017 under an Apache license and published on
<a href="https://github.com/ringgaard/sling">GitHub</a>, together with a
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07032">paper</a> describing the parser.</p>

<p>The parser used an academic corpus (OntoNotes) which was not very useful
from a practical point of view, so in 2019 I started working on a way of using
Wikipedia and <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> for constructing
training data for the parser. Part of this work involved taking Wikidata, which
is the knowledge base behind Wikipedia, and converting it into SLING frames.
These are then combined into a SLING store which allows you to efficiently read
the whole knowledge base into memory to do fast inference over the entire
knowledge graph.</p>

<h2>SLING</h2>
<p>Since I left Google in September 2020, I have been working on making a
pipeline that collects updates to Wikidata in real-time, as well as downloads
and processes Wikipedia in many different languages. These datasets are
reconciled with other data sources into
<a href="/knolbase">one single federated knowledge base</a> and published every
night.
This also produces alias tables, cross references, and search indices, which are
used for searching and navigating the knowledge base.
