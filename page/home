<h3>KnolCase: personal and collaborative knowledge management</h3>
<p>KnolCase is a collaborative case-based knowledge management tool
for gathering information about subjects of interest and organizing these into
case files.

This can be used by researchers, investigators, journalists
and others to collect, organize, share, and publish facts about topics.

You can create your own case files with topics like persons, companies,
organizations, places, articles, notes, documents, and references, and connect
topics through properties, essentially forming a network of linked topics.</p>
