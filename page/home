<p><b>KnolCase</b> is a <em>collaborative  case-based knowledge management tool</em> for
gathering information about subjects of interest and organizing these into case
files. This can be used by <em>researchers, investigators, journalists</em>
and others to collect, organize, share, and publish facts about topics.
It is a <em>personal, distributed knowledge base</em> tool.
You can create your own case files with topics like persons, companies,
organizations, places, articles, notes, documents, references, etc.
Topics are connected through properties, essentially forming a network of
linked topics.</p>

<p>The case files are stored locally on your computer giving you a high degree
of privacy.
You can choose to share your case file so others can view it or you can publish
the case topics in the public SLING knowledge base. You can also share your
case files privately.
Then your data will only be available to other users you have shared the
secret key with.
The data is end-to-end encrypted and only the encrypted version is stored
centrally.</p>

<p>You can choose to export your information to Wikidata to make your
contributions available to a broader audience. Then your information will
ultimately be available in places like Google search knowledge panels, Siri,
as well as many other places.</p>
