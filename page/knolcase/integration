<h2>Importing and exporting data</h2>

You can import data from local files on your computer into a case by selecting
"Import from file" in KnolCase menu (<h-icon>more_vert</h-icon>).
Choose the file format in the file dialog and then select the file to import.
The following file format are supported:
<ul>

<li><b>SLING frames</b> (*.sling): The case data as well as the knowledge base is
stored internally in <a href="https://github.com/ringgaard/sling">SLING</a> format.
You can import data in either SLING text or binary format.
The input file should consist of a stream of SLING frames.
Each frame is imported as a new topic, and each frame slot is imported as a
statement with a property and a value. Since SLING is the native format, it gives
you the most precise import in terms of data types and structure.
</li>

<li><b>JSON objects</b> (*.json): You can import JSON files with either a stream
of objects, e.g. one JSON object per line, or as one big array of JSON objects.
Each object is imported as a new topic and each key-value pair is imported as
one statement. The keys can either be property ids, e.g. "P569" or property
names or aliases, e.g. "birthdate". If the key ends with #, the value is
interpreted as an item id instead of a string.
</li>

<li><b>Tab-separated values</b> (*.tsv): TSV files are text files consisting of
lines separated by newlines, and each line has fields separated by tab.
The first line contains the field name, and each of the remaining lines are
imported as a new topic. Field names can be property ids, names or aliases. If
the field name ends with #, the value is interpreted as an item id instead of a
string.
</li>



<li><b>Comma-separated values</b> (*.csv):
<kb-topic qid="Q47479849" title="RFC4180"></kb-topic>-compliant CSV files can
be imported in the same way as tab-separated files.</li>

<li><b>QuickStatements</b> (*.qs):
<kb-topic qid="Q29032512" title="QuickStatements"></kb-topic> is a popular format for
importing data into <kb-topic qid="Q2013" title="Wikidata"></kb-topic>, but you can also
use it for importing data into case files. It is a simple text format which
makes it easy to generate data in Wikidata format, but you can also use the
<kb-topic qid="Q5583871" title="OpenRefine"></kb-topic> tool for cleaning up and
transforming you data, and then export the data in QuickStatements format.
KnolBase has a W3C Reconciliation Service API which you can use in OpenRefine
for reconciling your data.
</kb-topic></li>
</ul>

<h3>Wikidata export</h3>

<p>You can export case topics to Wikidata by selecting the topic(s) and clicking
the Wikidata button in the KnolCase toolbar.
The first time you do this, you are asked to authorize SLING to make changes to
Wikidata on your behalf.
For existing topics, which already have a Wikidata QID, the item will be updated
with new facts from the topic.
Otherwise, new Wikidata items will be created, and the new QID will be added to
the topic.
Exporting to Wikidata will never overwrite or delete any existing information
in Wikidata.

<p>Not all facts from topics can be exported to Wikidata. Statements which use
non-Wikidata properties or values will be skipped. Wikidata is also more strict
in terms of data types for properties, so statements where the data value type
does not match the property type will also be skipped.

<h3>Upload files</h3>

You can upload files from you computer to a case using the "Upload files"
command in the KnolCase menu (<h-icon>more_vert</h-icon>). This uploads the
selected files to the SLING drive server (drive.ringgaard.com), and adds a
document topic to the case for each uploaded file with information about the
filename, date, size, URL, and file type.

<p>The uploaded files can be accessed by anyone with the URL, but the URLs contain
a 64-bit crypto random key that makes it virtually impossible to guess the URL,
so in reality you need access to the case in order to view the uploaded files.
This should be good enough in most cases, but you should not use it to store
state secrets.

<h3>Backup and restore</h3>

<p>Your case files are stored in the browser's local database.
You can make a backup of all these by selecting "Backup" in the case manager
menu (<h-icon>more_vert</h-icon>).
This saves all the cases to a file that you can store in a safe place for
disaster recovery.
You can also use this to move your case files to another computer.

<p>The backup can be restored by clicking "Restore" in the case manager
menu (<h-icon>more_vert</h-icon>) and selecting the backup file.
This reads the backed up cases into your browser's local database.
This can be used to restore your case files if you have accidentally deleted them,
e.g. by clearing your cookies and local data.
You should be careful with having the same case files on multiple computers at the
same time as this can lead to conflicting updates. You can use collaborations for
cases that you need to access from more than one computer.
