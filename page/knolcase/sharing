<h2>Case sharing</h2>

<p>Your case files are stored locally on your own computer so no one else can
view them.
If you want to share your case file with others, you can click on the
<h-icon>share</h-icon> button in the toolbar.
Then you can choose between the following levels of sharing:
<ul>
<li><b>Private</b>: By default your case file is private and no one else can
view it. If you have shared or published you case file, you can always make it
private again by selecting 'Private'. This will delete the case file from the
case server.</li>
<li><b>Share</b>:
If you choose 'Share', your case file will be stored on the central case server.
You can click on the <h-icon>content_copy</h-icon> button to copy the sharing URL to the clipboard.
Others can then view the case file by opening the case URL (e.g. https://ringgaard.com/c/1234)
but they cannot modify it.
The master copy of the case file will still be on your own computer.
If you modify the case after it has been shared (shown in the case list
with a * in the status column), the changes will not be visible to others until
you share the case again.
</li>
<li><b>Restrict</b>:
Case sharing URLs are easy to guess because case ids are small consecutive
numbers, so they don't provide any real privacy. If you want to share your
case file with a closed audience, you can use restricted sharing instead.
This will only store an encrypted copy of the case file on the case server.
A secret 128-bit key is generated locally on your computer and the case data
is encrypted using AES-CBC encryption by your browser.
This makes it practically impossible to read you case file without knowledge of
the secret key.
Clicking <h-icon>content_copy</h-icon> will copy the secret URL to the clipboard,
and you can then use any secure form of communication to send this URL to
those you want to give access to the case. Others can reshare the URL, but you
can refresh the secret key by first making it private and then restricted
again. You master copy of the (unencrypted) case file will still be stored on
you local computer together with the secret key.
</li>
<li><b>Publish</b>: You can publish all the topics in your case in
<a href="/knolbase">KnolBase</a>.
This will make the topics in the case visible to all users.
KnolBase is rebuilt every night, so it can take up to 24 hours for your changes
to become available.
You can retract your changes by switching the case back to 'private'.
If you have extended existing topics, these will be merged during reconciliation.
Published topics will be available for searching in other case without having
to use case linking.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collaborations</h3>

<p>You can use case sharing to let other users view you cases, but they cannot
make changes to them. If you want to work together with other users on a case,
you can turn your case file into a <em>collaboration</em>. This will store the
case file on a collaboration server. Then all participants in the collaboration
can view and change the case file simultaneously. When a participant makes
changes to the case, they will be propagated and displayed immediately to all
other connected participants (like Google Docs).

<p>Before you can collaborate on a case, you need to set yourself as the
author of the case by adding an <kb-topic qid="P50" title="author"></kb-topic>
statement to the main case topic.
You can use your id from KnolCase or Wikidata, but if you are not in the
knowledge base, you can add a topic to the case for yourself.
Alternatively, you can make a biography case for yourself with your CV and
publish this case. You can then set your topic id (Ctrl+D) from this case as the
default author for new cases in the general settings (<h-icon>settings</h-icon>).

<p>You can turn a local case into a collaboration by selecting 'Collaborate'
in the case toolbar menu. You can then provide the URL for the collaboration server or
use the default (wss://ringgaard.com/collab/) and then click "Collaborate".
This moves the case from your own computer to the collaboration server and
creates your credentials for accessing the collaboration.

<p>After you have created the collaboration, you can start to invite other
participants, by clicking the <h-icon>people</h-icon> button in the case
toolbar.
You can search for the new participant or add a new participant to the
collaboration case itself. This adds the new participant to the main case
topic and copies the invite URL to the clipboard. You can then use any
(secure) communication medium to send the URL to the participant.

<p>When the new participant clicks the URL, the collaboration server will check
if the invite is valid. Please notice that invite URLs expires each time the
collaboration server is restarted. This means that invites to the default
collaboration server must be activated before the next day. If the invite is
valid, credentials for the participant is created and stored on their local
computer. Next time they want to access the collaboration, they can just click
on the collaboration case in the case list, and a connection to the
collaboration server will be established using the stored credentials.
