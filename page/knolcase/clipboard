<h3>Editing topics</h3>

<h3>Pictures</h3>

<p><kb-topic qid="Q1304336" title="A picture is worth a thousand words"></kb-topic> it is said.
You can add pictures to a topic by selecting a topic and pasting an image URL
into it. This adds the picture to the photo gallery of the topic.
You can browse the photo gallery by clicking on the photo to the right in the
topic panel.
To get the URL for a picture on any webpage, right-click on the image and
select "Copy image address" in the context menu (Chrome).

<p>Pictures on the internet often disappears after a short time. To prevent the
pictures in your case topics from disappearing, you can cache the images on the
SLING media cache service by selecting "Cache images" in the KnolCase menu in
the top right-hand corner. Then images will be cached in the background and you
will still be able to view them after they have disappeared from their original
location.

<p>Some sites do not allow <kb-topic qid="Q719934" title="hot-linking"></kb-topic>
which prevents images from these sites to be displayed properly in KnolCase.
In this case, you can paste the image into the topic instead of just the image URL.
You can copy an image by right-clicking on an image on a  webpage and selecting
"Copy image" in the context menu (Chrome).
When you paste an image into a topic, it will first be stored on
drive.ringgaard.com using a randomized URL, and then this image is added to the
topic.

<p>You can also paste <i>gallery URLs</i> into a topic. A gallery URL starts with
"gallery:" followed by a list of image URLs separated by space. This format is
supported by the
<a href="https://ringgaard.com/photosearch/">Reddit photo search</a> tool.
Albums from Reddit and Imgur are also supported.
You can search for images for a topic by clicking the
<h-icon>image_search</h-icon> button on the topic toolbar.

<h3>Articles</h3>

<p>Pasting a URLs from an article or webpage into the search box will create a
new topic for this page. You can also select a topic and paste the URL to add
information to an existing topic.
This is useful for keeping references to pages where you have found information
about a topic.
KnolCase uses the meta tags from the page to create a topic with information
about the page.
It supports Facebook OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD, Dublin Core, Sailthru,
as well as a number of generic meta tags.

<ul>
<li>title</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>webpage type</li>
<li>summary</li>
<li>language</li>
<li>author</li>
<li>image</li>
<li>canonical url</li>
<li>publisher</li>
<li>publication date</li>
</ul>

<p>KnolCase has a database of more than 3000 news sites with their Wikidata QIDs
to identify the publisher of a webpage.

<h3>Data tables</h3>

<p>You can import tables from spreadsheets by copying some rows and columns
into the clipboard and pasting these into a folder in KnolCase.
You can copy data from any source that supports comma-separated or tab-separated
values (CVS/TSV format).

<p>The first row should contain the property/column names. These can be property
ids (PIDs) or propety names.

<p>Each of the remaining rows are imported as a new topic.
If a column name ends with #, e.g. ID#, it is expected to contain item or topic
ids.
Otherwise, the value is parsed according to the data type of the property, e.g.
dates, number, urls, quantities, etc.

<h3>Plugins</h3>

<p>KnolCase has a number of <a href="https://github.com/ringgaard/sling/tree/master/case/plugin"><i>plug-ins</i></a>.
These are extensions that are loaded on-the-fly when you paste a URL that
matches the plug-in URL pattern.
Pictures, tables, and articles are examples of plug-ins that are used for
importing data from the clipboard, but KnolCase also has more specialized
plug-ins:

<ul>

<li><b>Twitter</b><br/>
If you paste a user profile URL from twitter.com into the search box, you can
add a new topic for the user to the current folder.
You can also paste the URL into the selected topic to extend this with
information from Twitter. This will retrieve name, description, gender (he/she),
location, profile photo and twitter username from Twitter.
If there is already an item in KnolBase with this twitter name, the topic will
be extended with the existing item.
URLs in the description, e.g. Facebook or Instagram, will be converted to
external references.
</li>

<li><b>VIAF</b><br/>
VIAF entity from viaf.org
</li>

<li><b>CVR</b><br/>
CVR persons and companies from virk.dk
</li>

<li><b>OpenCorporates</b><br/>
companies from opencorporates.com
</li>

<li><b>E-mail</b><br/>

</li>

<li><b>Phone number</b><br/>

</li>

<li><b>Linktree</b><br/>

<li><b>Google Maps</b><br/>

</li>

<li><b>Listal</b><br/>

</li>

<li><b>Wikidata</b><br/>
If you paste a URL from wikidata.org, it will be imported as a new topic with
all the properties from Wikidata item.
<a href="/knolbase">KnolBase</a> already contains all items from Wikidata, so
this is mostly useful for new items that are not yet in Knolbase.
</li>

<li><b>Wikipedia</b><br/>
If you paste an article URL from wikipedia.org, a new extension topic for the
Wikidata item corresponding to the Wikipedia article is added to the current
folder.
</li>

<!--
<p>Babepedia profile from babepedia.com
<p>Se & HÃ¸r profiles from hjemmestrik.dk
<p>Social media profiles from r/BeautifulFemales
<p>Video transcoding for avi, wmv, and mp4 video files
-->

</ul>

These plug-ins let you add a lot of information to topics by just copy and
pasting URLs.
For example, you can make a web search for a topic by clicking the
<h-icon>search</h-icon> button in the topic toolbar.
You can then find the sites with information about the topic and then copy the
URL for the webpage using Ctrl+L Ctrl+C.
Sometimes you might not even need to visit the webpage.
You can copy the result URL by left-clicking on the blue link and select
"Copy link address".

<h3>External references</h3>

<p>You can paste URLs from other sites with information about the topic.
This adds external references to the selected topic. You can also paste the URL
into the search box to create a new topic stub.
