<h2>Clipboard</h2>

<p>The clipboard is used for many things in KnolCase besides coping and pasting
text.

You can cut, copy and paste topics between folders.
When editing a topic, you can copy and paste statements, properties, and values.
You can also add pictures to topics using the clipboard.
KnolCase has a number of plug-ins that can be activated by pasting URLs into
the search box or a topic, letting you import information from other sites
or applications in a quick and easy manner.

<h3>Copying and moving topics</h3>

<p>You can cut, copy, and paste topics.
Ctrl-C copies the selected topic(s) to the clipboard.
You select a topic by clicking on the background of the topic card.
A topic has a blue border when it is selected.

<p>You can select multiple topics by selecting the first one and then then holding
down the Shift key when selecting the last topic.
You can also use the up and down keys to change the selection. Holding down the
Shift key will extend or shrink the selection.
Ctrl-A selects all topics in the current folder.
The topic(s) will be stored in SLING text format in the clipboard.

<p>Topics in the clipboard can be inserted into a folder with Ctrl-V.
This inserts the topic(s) right before the (first) selected topic
or at the end if no topics are selected in the current folder.

<p>A topic can be in multiple folders at the same time. When topics are copied
and pasted within the same case file, it just adds references to the existing
underlying topics in the case. If a topic is edited in one folder, the changes
will be shown in the other folders with a reference to the topic.

<p>Topics can also be copied between cases. This will assign new topic ids
to the pasted topics but it preserves the internal links between the topics.

<p>You can move topics by cutting them to the clipboard with Ctrl-X.
This will delete the topics from the current folder and add them to
the <i>scraps folder</i>.
You can then go to another folder and paste the topics into this.
This will move the topics from the scraps folder to the new folder.
The scrap folder is emptied when you save the case (Ctrl-S) or select "Clear"
from the scraps folder context menu.

<p>Ctrl-D copies the id of the selected topic to the clipboard and
Ctrl-E copies the topic name to the clipboard.
You can copy all the topics in the case file to the clipboard by selecting
"Copy all" in the KnolCase menu in the top right-hand corner.

<h3>Editing topics</h3>

<p>You can edit a topic by clicking the <h-icon>edit</h-icon> button in the
topic toolbar or by selecting the topic and pressing Enter.
In topic edit mode, you can select one or more statements, by selecting
them with the mouse, or by holding down Shift when moving around with the
arrow keys, just like you would do in any other text editor.

<p>Statements can be copied to the clipboard with Ctrl-C or cut with Ctrl-X.
When you copy a statement (i.e. a property with a value), the resolved property
and topic ids are preserved, so when you paste them back into the same topic
or another topic, they will refer to the same property and topic ids as the
place you copied them from.

<h3>Pictures</h3>

<p>"<kb-topic qid="Q1304336" title="A picture is worth a thousand words"></kb-topic>" it is said.
You can add pictures to a topic by selecting a topic and pasting an image URL
into it (i.e. a URL ending with .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .mp4, .webm, .webp, or .avif).
This adds the picture to the photo gallery of the topic.
You can browse the photo gallery by clicking on the photo to the right in the
topic card.
To get the URL for a picture on any webpage, right-click on the image and
select "Copy image address" in the context menu (Chrome).

<p>Pictures on the internet often disappear after a short time. To prevent the
pictures in your case topics from disappearing, you can cache the images on the
SLING media cache service by selecting "Cache images" in the KnolCase menu in
the top right-hand corner. Then images will be cached in the background and you
will still be able to view them after they have disappeared from their original
location.

<p>Some sites do not allow <kb-topic qid="Q719934" title="hot-linking"></kb-topic>
which prevents images from these sites from being displayed properly in KnolCase.
In this case, you can paste the image into the topic instead of just the image URL.
You can copy an image by right-clicking on an image on a  webpage and selecting
"Copy image" in the context menu (Chrome).
When you paste an image into a topic, it will first be stored on
drive.ringgaard.com using a randomized URL, and then this image is added to the
topic.

<p>You can also paste <i>gallery URLs</i> into a topic. A gallery URL starts with
"gallery:" followed by a list of image URLs separated by space. This format is
supported by the
<a href="https://ringgaard.com/photosearch/">Reddit photo search</a> tool.
Albums from Reddit and Imgur are also supported.
You can search for images for a topic by clicking the
<h-icon>image_search</h-icon> button on the topic toolbar.

<h3>Articles</h3>

<p>Pasting a URL from an article or webpage into the search box will create a
new topic for this page. You can also select a topic and paste the URL to add
information to an existing topic.
This is useful for keeping references to webpages and articles where you have
found information about a topic.

<p>KnolCase uses the meta tags from the webpage to create a topic with
information about the page.
It supports Facebook OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD, Dublin Core, Sailthru,
as well as a number of generic meta tags:
<ul>
<li>title</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>webpage type</li>
<li>summary</li>
<li>language</li>
<li>author</li>
<li>image</li>
<li>canonical url</li>
<li>publisher</li>
<li>publication date</li>
</ul>

<p>KnolCase has a database of more than 3000 news sites with their Wikidata QIDs
to identify the publisher of a webpage.

<p>For example, if you want to document the source for some fact in a topic, you
can add a <kb-topic qid="P1343" title="described by source"></kb-topic>
qualifier with the source:
<ol>
<li>Press Enter to make room for a new statement</li>
<li>Press Space on the new line to start a qualifier</li>
<li>Type 'source' and then Tab to add a <kb-topic qid="P1343" title="described by source"></kb-topic> property</li>
<li>Paste the URL for the source and press Tab.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will create a new topic for the web article with meta data and add this as the source.</p>

<h3>Data tables</h3>

<p>You can import tables from spreadsheets by copying some rows and columns
into the clipboard and pasting these into a folder in KnolCase.
You can copy data from any source that supports comma-separated or tab-separated
values (CVS/TSV format).

<p>The first row should contain the property/column names. These can be property
ids (PIDs) or property names.

<p>Each of the remaining rows are imported as a new topic.
If a column name ends with #, e.g. ID#, it is expected to contain item or topic
ids.
Otherwise, the value is parsed according to the data type of the property, e.g.
dates, number, URLs, quantities, etc.

<h3>Plug-ins</h3>

<p>KnolCase has a number of <a href="https://github.com/ringgaard/sling/tree/master/case/plugin"><i>plug-ins</i></a>.
These are extensions that are loaded on-the-fly when you paste a URL
that matches the plug-in URL pattern into the search box or a topic.

If you paste a URL into the search box you can select the plug-in in the search
results. This will add a new topic produced by the plug-on to the current folder.

Pasting a URL matching a plug-in into a topic will add the retrieved information
from the plug-in to the selected topic.

External references are checked against the cross-reference register in KnolBase
and the topic is extended with any matches found.

<p>Pictures, tables, and articles are examples of plug-ins that are used for
importing data through the clipboard, but KnolCase also has more specialized
plug-ins:
