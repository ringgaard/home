<h2>Case topics</h2>

<img src="/home/image/topic.jpg" style="float: right">

<p>A topic is similar to a <kb-topic qid="Q16222597" title="Wikidata item"></kb-topic>,
but is it local to the case file.
Topics are used to represent all the things in human knowledge, including
concepts, objects, subjects, and entities.
If a topic represents a concept or an abstract object, it usually has a
<kb-topic qid="P279" title="subclass of"></kb-topic> property.
If the topic represents a concrete object, e.g. a person, it usually has an <kb-topic qid="P31" title="instance of"></kb-topic>,
property which describes its type.
Many common topics will already be in KnolBase and Wikidata, so topics in
case files will often be new entities like persons, organization, locations,
and documents, but you can make topics for any entities and concepts you're interested in.

<p>Each topic is assigned a unique topic id which contains the case number as well as
a serial number within the case, e.g. topic number 10 in case #1234 will be assigned
t/1234/10 as its topic id.
Topic ids are never reused even if you delete the topic.

<p>A topic usually has a name and a description.
Topic names do not have to be unique.
The desciption can be used for disambiguating topics with the same name.
You can also add one or more aliases for the topic.
Theses can be different names the entity is known under, and spelling variations of these.

<p>A topic consists of a number of statements.
A statement has a property and a value.
You can use all the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:List_of_properties">properties defined by Wikidata</a>,
but you can also just use text for properties.
The datatype for the property value is determined by the property, but in most
cases you can override the predefined datatype, e.g. you can just specify a text
value for a reference property. KnolCase supports the following datatypes:
<ul>
<li><b>Text</b>: A simple string value. Text values can be localized by adding @ll to the string,
where "ll" is the two letter abbreviation for the language.</li>
<li><b>Number</b>: Numeric values can either be integers or decimal numbers.</li>
<li><b>Date</b>: Dates are specified with a precision. A normal date has year, month, and day of month,
but you can also specify dates where the precision is month, year, decade, century or millennium.</li>
<li><b>Reference</b>: Link to another topic.</li>
<li><b>Quantity</b>: A quantity is a number with a unit of measurement.</li>
<li><b>Geopoint</b>: Geographical reference with lattitude and longitude.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Qualifiers">qualify</a>
a statement with other statement to expand on, annotate, or
contextualize beyond what can be expressed in just a simple property-value pair.

Qualifiers are used in order to further describe or refine the value of a
property given in a statement.

A statement should still provide useful data even without a qualifier;
the qualifier is just there to provide additional information.

Qualifier can modify what a topic means, indicate how the value of
a property was determined, constrain the validity of the value, or offer further
details that cannot otherwise be expressed using simple property-value pairs.

Qualifiers are aldo used for temporal information like
<kb-topic qid="P585" title="point in time"></kb-topic> for
an event, or <kb-topic qid="P580" title="start"></kb-topic> and
<kb-topic qid="P582" title="end time"></kb-topic>
to specify the period where the statement applies.

<p>You can make a topic an extension of another topic by adding an "is:"
statement to the topic. If you publish the topic, it will be merged with the
topic it is extending. This can be used to add additional facts to an already
existing topic. If you add multiple "is:" statements to a topic, it will be
merged will all the extended topics during reconciliation.
