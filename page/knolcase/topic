<h2>Case topics</h2>

<img src="/home/image/topic.jpg" style="float: right">

<p>A topic is similar to a <kb-topic qid="Q16222597" title="Wikidata item"></kb-topic>,
but is it local to the case file.
Topics are used to represent all the things in human knowledge, including
concepts, objects, subjects, and entities.
If a topic represents a concept or an abstract object, it usually has a
<kb-topic qid="P279" title="subclass of"></kb-topic> property.
If the topic represents a concrete object, e.g. a person, it usually has an <kb-topic qid="P31" title="instance of"></kb-topic>,
property which describes its type.
Many common topics will already be in KnolBase and Wikidata, so topics in
case files will often be new entities like persons, organization, locations,
and documents, but you can make topics for any entities and concepts you're interested in.

<p>Each topic is assigned a unique topic id which contains the case number as well as
a serial number within the case, e.g. topic number 10 in case #1234 will be assigned
t/1234/10 as its topic id.
Topic ids are never reused even if you delete the topic.

<p>A topic usually has a name and a description.
Topic names do not have to be unique.
The desciption can be used for disambiguating topics with the same name.
You can also add one or more aliases for the topic.
Theses can be different names the entity is known under, and spelling variations of these.

<p>A topic consists of a number of statements.
A statement has a property and a value.
You can use all the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:List_of_properties">properties defined by Wikidata</a>,
but you can also just use text for properties.
The datatype for the property value is determined by the property, but in most
cases you can override the predefined datatype, e.g. you can just specify a text
value for a reference property. KnolCase supports the following datatypes:
<ul>
<li><b>Text</b>: A simple string value. Text values can be localized by adding @ll to the string,
where "ll" is the two letter abbreviation for the language.</li>
<li><b>Number</b>: Numeric values can either be integers or decimal numbers.</li>
<li><b>Date</b>: Dates are specified with a precision. A normal date has year, month, and day of month,
but you can also specify dates where the precision is month, year, decade, century or millennium.</li>
<li><b>Reference</b>: Link to another topic.</li>
<li><b>Quantity</b>: A quantity is a number with a unit of measurement.</li>
<li><b>Geopoint</b>: Geographical reference with lattitude and longitude.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Qualifiers">qualify</a>
a statement with other statement to expand on, annotate, or
contextualize beyond what can be expressed in just a simple property-value pair.

Qualifiers are used in order to further describe or refine the value of a
property given in a statement.

A statement should still provide useful data even without a qualifier;
the qualifier is just there to provide additional information.

Qualifier can modify what a topic means, indicate how the value of
a property was determined, constrain the validity of the value, or offer further
details that cannot otherwise be expressed using simple property-value pairs.

Qualifiers are aldo used for temporal information like
<kb-topic qid="P585" title="point in time"></kb-topic> for
an event, or <kb-topic qid="P580" title="start"></kb-topic> and
<kb-topic qid="P582" title="end time"></kb-topic>
to specify the period where the statement applies.

<p>You can make a topic an extension of another topic by adding an "is:"
statement to the topic. If you publish the topic, it will be merged with the
topic it is extending. This can be used to add additional facts to an already
existing topic. If you add multiple "is:" statements to a topic, it will be
merged will all the extended topics during reconciliation.

<h3>Editing topics</h3>

<p>You can edit a topic by clicking the <h-icon>edit</h-icon> button in the
topic toolbar or by pressing Enter when the topic is selected.
The topic editor works much like a normal text editor where you can use the
cursor and editing keys to move around and edit the topic facts.
Each line is a statement with a property and a value separated by colon.

<p>You add new statements by starting to type the property name on a blank line.
You can add blank lines by pressing Enter.
A search box with the matching properties is shown below the statement line.
The search list is updated as you type,  but you can also use Shift+Space to
open and close the search list.

Properties are ranked based on how common they are for the topic type
(<kb-topic qid="P31" title="instance of"></kb-topic> and
<kb-topic qid="P106" title="occupation"></kb-topic>).

You can select the property from the search list using the up and down keys or
click on the topic in the list.
Pressing Tab will select the first match in the list.
This adds the property to the statement and moves the cursor to the statement
value after the colon.
You can repeat the previous property by pressing Tab on a blank line.

<p>There are approximately 5000 properties in Wikidata plus more than
5000 cross reference properties. In addition to this, you can define custom
properties, or just use a text string as the property name. However, some
properties are more common than others, so you can select these with one-letter
shortcuts:
<ul>
<li><b>name</b> (shortcut n): name of the topic</li>
<li><b>alias</b> (shortcut a): other names for the topic</li>
<li><b>description</b> (shortcut d): topic description for disambiguation</li>
<li><b>instance of</b> (shortcut t): topic type</li>
<li><b>comment</b> (shortcut *): unstructured note</li>
</ul>

<p>Many topics are persons (aka <kb-topic qid="Q5" title="humans"></kb-topic>
in Wikidata lingo). Some common properties for persons are:
<ul>
<li><kb-topic qid="P569" title="date of birth"></kb-topic> (dob)</li>
<li><kb-topic qid="P19" title="place of birth"></kb-topic> (pob)</li>
<li><kb-topic qid="P570" title="date of death"></kb-topic> (dod)</li>
<li><kb-topic qid="P20" title="date of death"></kb-topic> (pod)</li>
<li><kb-topic qid="P551" title="residence"></kb-topic> (res)</li>
<li><kb-topic qid="P27" title="country of citizenship"></kb-topic> (citi)</li>
<li><kb-topic qid="P69" title="educated at"></kb-topic> (edu)</li>
<li><kb-topic qid="P106" title="occupation"></kb-topic> (occ)</li>
<li><kb-topic qid="P108" title="employer"></kb-topic> (empl)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use Ctrl+M (male) and Ctrl+F (female) as shortcuts to add
<kb-topic qid="P31" title="instance of"></kb-topic>: <kb-topic qid="Q5" title="human"></kb-topic>
and <kb-topic qid="P21" title="sex or gender"></kb-topic>: <kb-topic qid="Q6581097" title="male"></kb-topic>
or <kb-topic qid="Q6581072" title="female"></kb-topic> to the topic.

<p>Pressing Space at the beginning of the line make the statement a qualifier of
the previous statement.
A qualified statement can be unqualified by pressing Backspace at the beginning of the line.

<p>Statement values are entered much in the same way as properties, but it
searches for matching values in more places:
<ul>
<li>names and aliases for topics in the case file (‚≠ê)</li>
<li>linked cases (üóÑÔ∏è)
<li>names and aliases for topics in linked cases (üîó)</li>
<li>names and aliases for topics in KnolBase</li>
<li>dates (supported formats: "YYYY-MM-DD", "DD.MM.YYYY", "MM/DD/YYYY", "YYYY-MM", "YYYY",
"DD MMM YY, MMM YY", "YYY0s", "Month DD", "YYYY", "DD. Month, YYYY", "Month YYYY",
"MM/YYYY")</li>
<li>numbers (integers and decimal number)</li>
<li>quantities with units and conversion from imperial units (feet, inches, pounds)</li>
<li>geopoints with lattitude and longitude</li>
<li>localized names with language code</li>
<li>plug-in pattern matches</li>
<li>new topic with name</li>
</ul>

<p>The search ranking is based on overall item popularity as welll as how
common the item type is for the property.

If you you do no select a value from the search list, the statement value will
just be a text.

You can add unstructured notes to the topic by adding comments.
Comments are displayed with a bullet (‚ö´Ô∏é) in front, and they are not published
in the knowledge base.

<p>You can select one or more statements, by selecting them with the mouse, or
by holding down Shift when moving around with the arrow keys, just like you
would do in any other text editor.

Statements can be copied to the clipboard with Ctrl+C or cut with Ctrl+X.
When you copy a statement (i.e. a property with a value), the resolved property
and topic ids are preserved, so when you paste them back into the same topic
or another topic, they will refer to the same property and topic ids as the
place you copied them from.

<p>When you're done editing the topic, you can save the changes by clicking
<h-icon>save_alt</h-icon> or by pressing Ctrl+S.
If you regret the changes to the topic, you can discard them by clicking
<h-icon>cancel</h-icon> or pressing Esc.

<h3>Copying and moving topics</h3>

<p>You can cut, copy, and paste topics.
Ctrl+C copies the selected topic(s) to the clipboard.
You select a topic by clicking on the background of the topic card.
A topic has a blue border when it is selected.

<p>You can select multiple topics by selecting the first one and then then holding
down the Shift key when selecting the last topic.
You can also use the up and down keys to change the selection. Holding down the
Shift key will extend or shrink the selection.
Ctrl+A selects all topics in the current folder.
The topic(s) will be stored in SLING text format in the clipboard.

<p>Topics in the clipboard can be inserted into the current folder with Ctrl+V.
This inserts the topic(s) right after the (first) selected topic
or at the end if no topics are selected.

<p>A topic can be in multiple folders at the same time. When topics are copied
and pasted within the same case file, it just adds references to the existing
underlying topics in the case. If a topic is edited in one folder, the changes
will be shown in the other folders with a reference to the topic.

<p>Topics can also be copied between cases. This will assign new topic ids
to the pasted topics but it preserves the internal links between the topics.

<p>You can move topics by cutting them to the clipboard with Ctrl+X.
This will delete the topics from the current folder and add them to
the <i>scraps folder</i>.
You can then go to another folder and paste the topics into this.
This will move the topics from the scraps folder to the new folder.
The scrap folder is emptied when you save the case (Ctrl+S) or select "Clear"
from the scraps folder context menu.

<p>Ctrl+D copies the id of the selected topic to the clipboard and
Ctrl+E copies the topic name to the clipboard.
You can copy all the topics in the case file to the clipboard by selecting
"Copy all" in the KnolCase menu in the top right-hand corner.

<h3>Case folders</h3>

<p>Topics are organized into folders. The folder list is to the left of the
topic panel and you can open and close it by clicking the <h-icon>menu</h-icon>
icon in the upper-left corner. The current folder is shown in bold and you can
switch to another folder by clicking it in the folder list.

<p>You can add new folders by clicking <h-icon>create_new_folder</h-icon> above
the folder list. Each folder has a context menu (<h-icon>more_vert</h-icon>) with
functions for renaming the folder, moving the folder up and down in the list,
and for deleting the folder. A folder can only be deleted if it is empty.
