<h2>Case files</h2>

<p>KnolCase organizes topics and facts around case files.
A case file groups topics about a subject into a single document.
Case files are stored locally on your own computer in the browser's local
database (<kb-topic qid="Q125176" title="IndexedDB"></kb-topic>).

<blockquote><em>NB: Please notice that if you use KnolCase in <kb-topic qid="Q2890907" title="incognito mode"></kb-topic>,
your case file will be deleted by the browser when you close the browser window,
so you shouldn't use KnolCase in incognito mode for cases that you want to keep.
You should also be careful when clearing cookies and browsing data.
It is important NOT to delete the local site data (for ringgaard.com).
Otherwise all your case files will be deleted.
There are no backup copies on ringgaard.com of your case files, so they will be gone for good.
You're advised to back up your case data on a regular basis.
</em></blockquote>

<p>Each case file is assigned a unique case number by a central case numbering service.
You can view or edit a case by going to the url for the case,
e.g. <a hef="https://ringgaard.com/c/1234">https://ringgaard.com/c/1234</a> for case #1234.
You can only edit a case if you're the owner of the case.
Also, the case can only be viewed by others if it has been shared.
By default a case is private, so it cannot be viewed by anyone else.

<p>A case file contains a number of topics grouped into folders.
A topic can be in multiple folders.
The first topic in the Main folder is the case topic, which is the topic for the case itself.
The case topic cannot be deleted.
It contains information about the case file like name, description, author, and case number,
but you can add any information you like to the main topic, e.g. a
<kb-topic qid="P921" title="main subject"></kb-topic> with a reference to the central entity of the case.

<h3>Opening a new case</h3>

<p>Click the <h-icon>add</h-icon> button to open a new case.
Type the name of the case you want to research and an optional description.
Then click "Create".
This opens the new case and you can now start to add topics to the case.

<p>You add new topics to the case by typing the name of the topic in the
search bar.
If the topic is already in the knowledge base, you can just select it from
the search list.
This creates a topic that is an extension of an existing topic and you can click
<h-icon>expand_more</h-icon> to see the existing information.
Otherwise, pressing Enter without selecting a topic will create a new topic.

<p>After you have made changes to the case, you can save it by
clicking <h-icon>save</h-icon> or by pressing Ctrl+S.
The case file is stored in the local database in your browser.

<h3>Managing your case files</h3>

<p>The KnolCase home screen (<a hef="https://ringgaard.com/c/">https://ringgaard.com/c/</a>)
shows you a list of all your case files on the computer.
Case files are local to the computer and user, so you can only see the case
files you have created on this computer with this user account.
The case list shows the case number, status,  name, description, creation date,
and last modification date.
The most recently modified cases are shown first.
You can open a case by clicking on it in the list.
You can delete a case by clicking the <h-icon>delete</h-icon> button.
Only the local link will be deleted for linked cases and collaborations.
<p>The status icons show the status of each case:

<table>
<tr>
  <td><h-icon>share</h-icon></td>
  <td>case that you have shared so anyone with the case number can view it</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><h-icon>lock</h-icon></td>
  <td>case that you have shared secretly so it can only be viewed by other users with the secret key;
      only an encrypted copy of the case will be stored on the server</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><h-icon>link</h-icon></td>
  <td>link to case that someone else has shared</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><h-icon>key</h-icon></td>
  <td>link with secret key to encrypted case that someone else has shared with you</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><h-icon>public</h-icon></td>
  <td>case that you have published making all topics in the case available in <a href="/knolbase">KnolBase</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><h-icon>people</h-icon></td>
  <td>link to collaboration case which can be viewed and edited by all participants in the collaboration</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>*</td>
  <td>case has been modified since it was last shared</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>(no&nbsp;icon)</td>
  <td>private case that is only stored locally and not shared with anyone</td>
</tr>
<table>
