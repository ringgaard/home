<h2>Case files</h2>

<p>KnolCase organizes topics and facts around case files.
A case file groups topics about a subject into a single document.
Case files are stored locally on your own computer in the browser's local
database (<kb-topic qid="Q125176" title="IndexedDB"></kb-topic>).

<p>Each case file is assigned a unique case number.
You can view or edit a case by going to the url for the case,
e.g. <a hef="https://ringgaard.com/c/1234">https://ringgaard.com/c/1234</a> for case #1234.
You can only edit the case if you're the owner of the case.
Also, the case can only be viewed by others if it has been shared.
By default a case is private, so it cannot be viewed by anyone else.

<p>A case file contains a number of topics grouped into folders.
A topic can be in multiple folders.
The first topic in the Main folder is the case topic, which is the topic for the case itself.
The case topic cannot be deleted.
It contains information about the case file like name, description, author, and case number,
but you can add any information you like to the main topic, e.g. a
<kb-topic qid="P921" title="main subject"></kb-topic> with a reference to the central entity of the case.

<h3>Opening a new case</h3>

<p>Click the <h-icon>add</h-icon> button to open a new case.
Type the name of the case you want to research and an optional description.
Then click "Create".
This opens the new case and you can now start to add topics to the case.

<p>You add new topics to the case by typing the name of the topic in the
search bar.
If the topic is already in the knowledge base, you can just select it from
the search list.
This creates a topic that is an extension of an existing topic and you can click
to see the existing information.
Otherwise, pressing Enter without selecting a topic will create a new topic.
